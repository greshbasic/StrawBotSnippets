# StrawBotSnippets
The purpose of this repository is to show small snippets of my "StrawBot" Discord bot.

What does StrawBot do?

- StrawBot does A LOT. But in short, StrawBot has commands for moderation, general utility, its own economy game, web scrapping, ChatGPT, and a bunch of other miscellaneous stuff.

Are the snippets 1:1 with StrawBot's code?

- Nope. All of the provided snippets have missing context, contain edited versions of commands, or both.

How many people use StrawBot?
- It is hard to gauge an exact amount of people who interact with StrawBot, but StrawBot itself interacts with over 100,000 people on an average day, be that adding a reaction to someone's message, replying to their command(s), or even banning them.
