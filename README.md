# StrawBotSnippets
The purpose of this repository is to show small snippets of my "StrawBot" Discord bot so people can see what it is all about, enjoy!

Q1: What does StrawBot do?

A1: Thanks for asking. StrawBot does A LOT. But in short, StrawBot has commands for moderation, general utility, its own economy game, web scrapping, ChatGPT, and a bunch of other miscellaneous stuff!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2: Who is involved in the making of StrawBot?

A2: Just me! It started as a winter break project in December of 2022 and I have been the sole developer ever since!

Q3: Are the snippets 1:1 with StrawBot's code?

A3: Nope. All of the provided snippets have missing context, contain editted versions of commands, or both.
