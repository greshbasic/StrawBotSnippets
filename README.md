# StrawBotSnippets
The purpose of this repository is to show small snippets of my "StrawBot" Discord bot so people can see what it is all about, enjoy!

What does StrawBot do?

- Thanks for asking. StrawBot does A LOT. But in short, StrawBot has commands for moderation, general utility, its own economy game, web scrapping, ChatGPT, and a bunch of other miscellaneous stuff!

Who is involved in the making of StrawBot?

- Just me! It started as a winter break project in December of 2022 and I have been the sole developer ever since!

Are the snippets 1:1 with StrawBot's code?

- Nope. All of the provided snippets have missing context, contain editted versions of commands, or both.

How many people use StrawBot?
- Good question. It is hard to gauge an exact amount, but StrawBot itself interacts with over 100,000 people on an average day, be that adding a reaction to someone's message, replying to their command(s), or even banning them.
