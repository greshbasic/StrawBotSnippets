# StrawBotSnippets
The purpose of this repository is to show small snippets of my "StrawBot" Discord bot so people can see what it is all about, enjoy!

Q: What does StrawBot do?

A: Thanks for asking. StrawBot does A LOT. But in short, StrawBot has commands for moderation, general utility, its own economy game, web scrapping, ChatGPT, and a bunch of other miscellaneous stuff!

Q: Who is involved in the making of StrawBot?

A: Just me! It started as a winter break project in December of 2022 and I have been the sole developer ever since!

Q: Are the snippets 1:1 with StrawBot's code?

A: Nope. All of the provided snippets have missing context, contain editted versions of commands, or both.
